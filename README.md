# webfaction-migrate
This is the beginning of a script that uses the Webfaction API to create everything in Webfaction (the database, the application, the website, etc) and then copy the database from a remote host into the mysql db created at Webfaction.  TODO: it must be completed with a command to rsync the php files over... This is left as an exercise for the reader.  

Please note, this was written in late 2014 so things may have changed with the WF api since then.  If anyone completes this, please let me know, and/or send a pull request! thank you.
